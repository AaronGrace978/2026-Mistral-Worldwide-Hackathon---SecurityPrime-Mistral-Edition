# SecurityPrime — Demo Video Script

**Target length:** 2–3 minutes
**Vibe:** Confident, fast-paced, no filler. Show don't tell.

---

## [0:00–0:15] HOOK — What is this?

**SHOW:** App dashboard, full screen

**SAY:**

> "This is SecurityPrime — a full cybersecurity suite for your desktop, where Mistral AI is the brain behind every security decision. It's not a chatbot bolted onto a settings page. It's 17 real security modules, all powered by Mistral models."

---

## [0:15–0:40] THE PROBLEM

**SHOW:** Stay on dashboard, point at security score

**SAY:**

> "Endpoint security today is either enterprise bloatware that costs a fortune, or consumer antivirus that barely does anything. And when tools add AI, it's a black box — you have no idea what data is leaving your machine or where it's going.
>
> SecurityPrime fixes both. Real protection. Real AI. Full transparency."

---

## [0:40–1:20] MISTRAL INTEGRATION — The Brain

**SHOW:** Navigate to the AI Copilot page. Type a question like "What's the biggest risk on my system?" and show the streaming response.

**SAY:**

> "We use four Mistral models, each for a different job.
> Mistral Large for deep threat analysis and security audits.
> Ministral for fast triage — quick questions, instant answers.
> Devstral for code — generating firewall rules, remediation scripts.
> And Pixtral for visual analysis, like inspecting screenshots for phishing.
>
> The routing engine picks the right model automatically. Fast models for simple stuff, large models when it matters."

**SHOW:** Point at the model name in the streaming response. Show Settings > AI API Keys briefly.

> "Judges — you can paste your own Mistral API key right here in Settings. It hits api.mistral.ai directly. No Ollama needed."

## [1:20–1:50] FEATURE TOUR — Quick Hits

**SHOW:** Click through each page for 3–4 seconds each. Don't linger.

**SAY (as you click through):**

> "Malware scanner — quick, full, and custom scans with memory forensics."

*(click to Firewall)*

> "Firewall management — real Windows Firewall rules via netsh."

*(click to Encryption)*

> "File encryption — AES-256-GCM, real crypto, not a wrapper."

*(click to Network)*

> "Network monitor — live connections, traffic analysis."

*(click to Vulnerability)*

> "Vulnerability scanner — CVE-aware, with remediation guidance."

*(click to Compliance)*

> "GDPR and HIPAA compliance tracking."

---

## [1:50–2:15] TRUST THROUGH OBSERVABILITY

**SHOW:** Navigate to Network page, show the domain trust classification or Little Snitch rules

**SAY:**

> "Here's our differentiator. SecurityPrime tells you exactly which network endpoints the AI is allowed to reach. Every domain is classified — trusted, unknown, or suspicious. You can export these as Little Snitch rules on macOS. Total transparency. You don't have to trust us — you can verify."

---

## [2:15–2:40] TECH & WRAP-UP

**SHOW:** Back to dashboard or show the README on GitHub briefly

**SAY:**

> "Built with Rust and Tauri on the backend. SvelteKit on the frontend. SQLite for local persistence. All API keys stored in your OS keychain — never in files.
>
> This isn't a prototype. It's 17 Rust modules, real crypto, real scanning, and Mistral AI as the core reasoning layer across all of it.
>
> SecurityPrime. AI-native endpoint security you can trust."

## TIPS FOR RECORDING

- **Screen record the app** — OBS, Loom, or just Win+G (Xbox Game Bar)
- **Voiceover is fine** — you don't need to be on camera
- **Don't rehearse to perfection** — one clean take with energy beats a polished robot
- **If you stumble, keep going** — judges care about the product, not your editing
- **Make sure the app is running** with a Mistral API key set so the AI Copilot actually responds live
- **Dark mode on** — it looks way better on video
